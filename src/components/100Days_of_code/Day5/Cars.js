import React from 'react'

// Given an array of objects representing a list of cars. Each object consists of: id, name, price, category. Build a React component that shows on the DOM the total number of cars present in each category. For Example: if there are categories, luxury and sports, where there are 5 luxury cars and 2 sports car then the data should be represented as:

const Cars = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Solution :9</h2>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Cars
